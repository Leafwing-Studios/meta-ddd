# Special Roles
In addition to the team structure in DDD, there are a number of special roles to be assigned to team members, although one person may have several roles. Roles are divided into **brass roles** for members of the brass, and **team roles**. For team roles, there is a different member (or members) with this role for each team, but brass roles take on responsibilities across teams. Lastly, there are **special roles** which give names to common role combinations. Not every team needs every role, but every team needs a [Steward](/) and most teams will have a [Sage](/). For large projects or companies (that have multiple teams), a [Quartermaster](/) is also required.

## Librarian (Brass)
Alternate names: *Archivist*

The **Librarian** is a brass role with the following responsibilities:
- Ensure that the teams have places for their documentation
- Find good documentation tools and ensure easy access
- Update company documentation tooling with additional functionality
- Act as an escalation point for [Scribes](/) who have company reaching issues, and for issues between team's Scribes
- Act as the liaison between teams and the rest of The Brass.

## Executor (Brass)
The **Executor** is a brass role with the following responsibilities:
- Run [periodic check-in](/) meetings
- Act as an escalation point for [Keepers](/) who have company reaching issues, and for issues between team's Keepers
- Act as the liaison between teams and the rest of The Brass.
