# The Guidebook

We're reaching levels of meta-thinking never thought possible. This is the guidebook for DDD itself. The documentation and implementation for the DDD framework itself uses DDD to manage it's complexity and design. As such, it is a kind of self-descriptive system. This is the guidebook for creating the framework of DDD. This includes our goals, properties, constraints, tolerances, and uncertainties for the DDD framework itself.
