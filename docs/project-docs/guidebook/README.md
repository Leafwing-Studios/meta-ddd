# The Guidebook {stub}

This is the place where things go, that don't really belong anywhere else.

Spitballin:
- metadata contains
  - key uncertainties for the system
  - design constraints for the system (you can't do X)
  - required properties (the system must be ablt to do X)
  - desired properties (it would be nice if the system could do X)
  - tolerances/assumpteions (this system assumes X about external systems, this system an accept any of Y from external systems. also contains this kind of flexibility for users. lastly, contains tuning levers (maybe their own section?))
- metadata always with the system
- metadata for systems in a special section of the main guidebook? this guidebook would contain sections for
  - system metadata
  - "guides"
    - code review checklist type thing
    - code style guide
    - faq
    - how the guidebook and other meta-resources are maintained?
    - where you write your own design constraints. dig holes before you fill them!
  - unstructured stuff
    - meeting minutes
    - role assignments
- the system metadata is generally defined before *and* during a proposal's work/acceptance, but the information stays relevant until (nearly) the death of the project
