# The Guidebook {stub}

The **Guidebook** is a system in DDD.

### Metadata

#### Key Uncertainties
- Should we have an optional fork to have system metadata in the main guidebook instead of distributing it?
- We need some guidelines for "I have a piece of information, where does it go?"
- Is the "is / ought" divide useful for categorizing information? (Documentation contains "is", guidebook contains "ought")
- What is the exact structure of the guidebook? Which pieces of information go where?

#### Design Constraints
- TEMP

#### Required Properties
- Must be able to contain:
  - Global metadata
  - Code review checklists (or some similar)
  - Code style guide
  - FAQ
  - Less structured information
    - Meeting minutes
    - Role assignments
- Must be able to hold implementation-specific changes to the DDD formula. Ex: "Our team does things *this* way, which is not normal"

#### Desired Properties
- Can contain:
  - System metadata
- Independent searching from the rest of the docs

#### Tolerances
- TEMP
