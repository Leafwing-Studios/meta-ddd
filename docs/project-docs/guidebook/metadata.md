# Metadata {stub}

The **metadata** of a system or project is the design information that describes the system from the designer's point of view. This includes information about **what they system was aiming to do, what rules it must follow** in its design, and **other stuff.** ~MAKE A FULL LIST.

Every system has associated metadata, which should be stored alongside the system's **definition.** Ideally, these should be in the same file. Additionally, there is some metadata that is stored *globally*. This is for things that reach across the whole project, such as key uncertanties about systems that haven't been made yet, or the projects overall goals. Global metadata is typically stored in the Guidebook, but it doesn't have to be.

The metadata framwork is as follows:

## Key Uncertanties

## Design Constraints

## Required Properties

## Desired Properties

## Tolerances
