# The Regular Check-in {stub}

A system that cannot update and improve itself can and will fall into disrepair as issues are ignored, and the team drifts away from its own specifications. The **regular check-in** is how DDD avoids slipping into this pattern. Periodically, about every two weeks, all members of a project come together to do a bit of meta-work, improving their internal systems themselves. DDD, while carefully designed, is not set in stone. As time goes on, its pieces are constantly revisited and revised to ensure that they are up to date, and fully serving the project's team(s). **The regular check-in is the most important part of DDD.**

For a project with only one team, this meeting is called and regularly scheduled by the [Keeper](/). For a project with several teams, these responsibilities are handed off to the [Executor](/). The meeting follows the following steps:
1. If the project has multiple teams, each team gives a brief update on what they've been doing
1. The teams reviews guidebook analytics. Talk about the sections that are being the least used. Their value is called into question.
1. Review guidebook overrides. Talk about which pieces have been overridden the most frequently. Their value is called into question.
1. Propose new information for the guidebook at a project level. (When teams discover things that the whole project should include. These are submitted in advance, for everyone to read.)
1. Open floor for any team member to complain about issues with the current process.

### Metadata

#### Constraints
- [required] Prevents the DDD system from falling out of usefulness
- [required] Provides an explicit time to air grievances with the process, even if the Brass thinks there aren't any problems
- [required] Improves knowledge between different parts of the project
- [expected] Relatively non-susceptible to poor suggestions being taken due to popularity

#### Tolerances

#### Uncertainties
- How should this change for the multi-team case?
