# The DDD Command Structure: Orthogonality and The Brass

DDD manages overhead efficiently. It may seem impossible to keep key stakeholders at the development table in a traditional company. When working with an external client, the DDD team *requires* a stakeholder that can allocate 80% or more of their time to the team. However, if the business is more self-contained, then the DDD company is more free to streamline overhead to provide additional accessibility. DDD teams and companies are generally quite flat in their command structure, and advancement is largely orthogonal to that command structure. Companies and teams wanting to run DDD are encouraged to implement as much of these strategies as possible.

## Advancement and Allocation Within the Teams

In a traditional company, advancement is closely tied to the command structure of the company. People go from engineer, to senior engineer, to project lead, and so on. This contains the implicit assumption that management is inherently harder or more valuable, and that skilled engineers must become skilled managers to continue advancing. We reject this idea. Management is not inherently harder, but it is *different.*

In DDD, advancement is orthogonal to the command structure, meaning that they are not related and move in different directions. On a DDD team or organization, promotion does not cause a shift from construction to management. Senior employees generally paid higher salaries, but their core responsibilities remain unchanged. They are typically put on projects or teams with difficult work to be done, and spend more time answering questions and mentoring junior staff, but they do not directly *manage* that junior staff.

For an employee to move into the command structure, they do not need to have some number of years of experience, and management roles do not automatically get higher pay than everyone else. For large projects (with **parent teams**), members are not elevated to parent teams because of management ability, nor do parent teams have the most skilled members. That allocation is determined by which members are better at *high-level, abstract thinking* vs *low-level, concrete thinking.* To move into the management level of a DDD company, members join **The Brass.**

Do we need an example here?

## The External Level for DDD Companies

When running DDD on a company scale, there is work to consider other than just making the product. Every business needs **resource allocation, strategic planning, and internal maintenance.** Those jobs need people, and companies need people to manage those people. At a DDD company, this is handled by **The Brass.**

The Brass is the "meta-level" of the company. While making products is all well and good, at some point this is a business. The Brass contains all the people who are required to keep the company running. This means the brass includes not only the company's "high command", but also the accountant, lawyer, marketer, janitor, etc. Because DDD teams are autonomous, The Brass does not need to be very large. It doesn't contain the standard management hierarchy, because DDD doesn't need one.

The Brass is has the following responsibilities. These have been talked about much better in other business literature, so we won't go into too much detail here:
1. **Resource Allocation:** Who should be on which project? Which members are better at an abstract vs concrete level? What should we do with budget surpluses? How much money can we afford to spend on new equipment?
1. **Strategic Planning:** What's our niche that we're serving? Which projects should we be looking to pick up? How is our company going to expand in the next 5 years? Which markets should we be taking advantage of? Who's our biggest competitor and how do we beat them?
1. **Internal Maintenance:** Who should we hire or fire? Do we need new equipment? What's our system for keeping the office in shape and keeping resources accessible to employees?

The Brass can be structured similar to a traditional management level, but it doesn't have to be as long as it can fulfill the requirements stated above. For example, the company could use a co-op structure for working, or use pure democratic voting for deciding these responsibilities. Additionally, it is quite common (and even recommended) that members of The Brass hold positions on DDD teams part time, allocating some of their time to Brass duties and some to development. This ensures a closer relationship between The Brass and the crew, and helps ensure Brass overhead is very light.
