# How to Write Your Proposals {stub}

- Make a pull request, with some metadata along with it (author, date, and other things)
- Flag parts of the proposal as needing help (unfinished holes that must be patched, weak solutions that should be improved, etc.)
- The must be available in written form before the meeting, so people can read them ahead of time
- Proposals should still be presented in the metting by someone (although it needn't necessarily be the author) for people that have difficulty getting things read ahead of time
