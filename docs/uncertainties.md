# Key Uncertainties
- Who actually reviews the pull request? The Keeper? The Sage? The Scribe?
- What is the exact framework for test documentation?
- Issue tracking structure needs to be fleshed out
- Examples for team structure section?
- How can we make it more clear that the DDD teams are autonomous and don't need or have traditional management oversight?
- How can we communicate that traditional management structures are usually a lot of overhead for little benefit, and that we fix that problem?
- There are definitely brass jobs without roles that should probably be defined
- We have the Quartermaster, which role is the battlemaster equivalent?
- Explicit information on automating away overhead. 
  - For example, if you automate testing and data analysis tools, and open them to the team, you don't need the overhead of data scientists and manager approval to run these tests (only to spit out reports that most people don't even understand). 
  - Stitch fix did this and have useful docs
    - [Multi-Armed Bandits - generalization of A/B testing for reinforcement learning](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/08/05/bandits/)
    - [Automated Experiment API](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2019/07/30/building-centralized-experimental-platform/)
- Use transparency to remove the need for recursive "whip-cracking" behavior. (Many companies do this to ensure Work Is Done:tm:.) How to make this clear?
- We need a "I have a piece of information, where does it go?" section
  - Documentation contains "is" statements. What is this system, how does it work, how would it work if things were different?
  - Guidebook contains "ought" statements. What do we want this to be? What goals are we trying to fulfil? What things are we unwilling to accept?
  - The test documentation contains tests and failures. While the documentation and guidebook primarily contain the "what", the test documentation contains the "why" (and sometimes "how"). Why did this system not work? Why do we have X technical constraint in our guidebook? 
  - VCS contains the past, key uncertainties contain the future
  - Issue tracking contains things that need to be done, but do not require discussion or debate. This includes both things that are already discussed, but need to be finished out, and things that are so small an simple to not merit discussion at all (like tiny bug fixes)
- Does DDD require aftercare? What would the aftercare format look like?
