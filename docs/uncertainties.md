# Key Uncertainties
- Who actually reviews the pull request? The Keeper? The Sage? The Scribe?
- What is the exact framework for test documentation?
- Issue tracking structure needs to be fleshed out
- Examples for team structure section?
- How can we make it more clear that the DDD teams are autonomous and don't need or have traditional management oversight?
- How can we communicate that traditional management structures are usually a lot of overhead for little benefit, and that we fix that problem?
- There are definitely brass jobs without roles that should probably be defined
- We have the Quartermaster, which role is the battlemaster equivalent?
